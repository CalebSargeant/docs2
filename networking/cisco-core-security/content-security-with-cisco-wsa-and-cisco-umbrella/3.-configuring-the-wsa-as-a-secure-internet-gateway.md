## Decryption Policy Overview

* Client initiates TLS session with site
* WSA initiates TLS session with site on client's behalf
* Site sends signed certificate to present to client
* WSA sends signed copy of site's certificate

### Configuring Certificates on the WSA

**Self-Signed Certificates**
* Certificates will need to be added to every endpoint
* Not scalable

**Add Certificate to PKI**
* Endpoints already trust certificates signed by CA
* More scalable

## Installing Certificates on the WSA
