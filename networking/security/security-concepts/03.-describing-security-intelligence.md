# 03. Describing Security Intelligence

## Security Intelligence Overview

### Hard to Keep up with Threats

* Not a "set it and forget it" solution
* Cant just sit back and monitor
* Too many devices to manually update
* A large amount of surface areas

### Too Much Work

Identify threats, research solutions, and implement mitigations for every threat on each attack medium

### Security Intelligence

* Organisations can participate in a community of security devices
  * All organisations benefit from new threat information
* Author, share, and consume

## Security Intelligence Authoring, Sharing, and Consuming

### Telemetry Sharing

Device upload data to network/Cloud

**Scenario:**

* Threat affects organisation
* Device now has info on threat
* Info is uploaded to cloud
* Additional info is uploaded from other orgs

### Security Intelligence

* Cloud performs analytics
* Normalises data and finds pattens
  * Time, duration, surface area, other metrics
  * Who is being attacked
  * More info allows for better mitigations
* Create signatures for different threats
* Different security devices have different mitigations
* Updates are shared with community
  * Cisco Talos can be every 3-5min
* Each device installs the updates
* All organizations participating in the cloud are protected from the new threat
* Mo manual input required
* Provides research and info to security professionals
* Allows you to stay in the loop of the new types of threats that are emerging
